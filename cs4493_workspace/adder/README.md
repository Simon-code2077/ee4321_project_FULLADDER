# ADDER implementation
This is part of design project as well as ps_6. The aim is to design a 8-bit twoâ€™s complement adder. We choose ** as our adder arch.
## Results may be expected
1. Sized schematics
2. Bit-stack layout of your adder design (remember to begin by making a tiling
diagram and then stick layouts of your cells). We aware that the bit-stack
you define here will be the bit-stack that you will have to use for the remain-
der of the components in your datapath.
3. Spectre or Spectre FX results for the delay of the critical path
4. Spectre FX runs to verify functionality
 
Attention! No layout version are done so far.
